given: 
- set of theorems and tactic proofs
- a set of generated proof completions for each theorem
goal:
- RM evaluation set: triples of form (proof state, correct tactic, incorrect tactic)
approach:
- use a current SOTA model to sample proofs
- SOTA solve rate on miniF2F is still ~50% (32-128) attempts, so we'll still get incorrect proofs
- pass all attempts through Lean verifier
- for incorrect attempts, we get a correct tactic t_i if t_1,...t_i does not appear in a correct proof

second step:
- use LeanDojo to verify the generated proofs
- LeanDojo provides interaction via `run_tac`
- we need to extract the individual tactics from the generated proofs (which contain comments)
