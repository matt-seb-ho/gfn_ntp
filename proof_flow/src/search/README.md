## `search` subpackage

These files are based on those from the [ReProver repo](https://github.com/lean-dojo/ReProver/tree/main). 
They were copied from ReProver/prover/* and ReProver/common.py at the `b5c1e5b` commit ([link](https://github.com/lean-dojo/ReProver/commit/b5c1e5bff3281c33132841bdaddb7a56f450b1bc)).

They have been modified in this subpackage to:
- [ ] optionally save search trees (for as input data)
- [ ] include a progress bar
- [ ] support for custom prompts
- [ ] torch_dtype="auto" for loading models from HuggingFace
